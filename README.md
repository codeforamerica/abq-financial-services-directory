# ALBUQUERQUE FINANCIAL SERVICES DIRECTORY

This is a early stage prototype using mock data for a directory that we're creating to help residents find local financial services. It will be the basis for our next step of creating a intake form that will sort the directory to the residents type of need and immediacy. 

We're using Tabletop.js and SheetSee.js to demo this.
